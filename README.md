2. ##  [Patent](nigeria)
**Effect Selection for predictors of lambda and pi in zero-inflated Poisson model on patent citation data. Calculates various (proper) scores for 10-Fold CV.**
Data is available.

##  [Simulated Effects](effect_sims)
**Simulates data for effect selection in simple Gaussian mean model and plots recomposed effect estimates on basis of linear samples and samples of nonlinear deviations.**
